#  Introduction

Since the rise of the Internet one of the most important factors of communication and information technology has been the security of information. It is necessary to protect this information while communicated over insecure channels. Thus, a need exists for developing technology that will help protect the integrity of digital content and secure the intellectual property rights of owners. 

 This has resulted in an explosive growth of the field of information hiding. In addition, the rapid growth of publishing and broadcasting technology also requires an alternative solution in hiding information. To overcome this problem, some invisible information can be embedded in the digital media in such a way that it could not be easily extracted without a specialized technique.

One and most widely used for securing data is Steganography. The word steganography is derived from the Greek words “stegos” meaning “cover” and “grafia” meaning “writing” defining it as “covered writing”.

Today, steganography is mostly used on computers with digital data being the carriers and networks being the high speed delivery channels. It is a performance that inserts secret messages into a cover file, so that the existence of the messages is not apparent.
